# Libraries Backend Part

This project manages books catalog in some libraries.

It lets find books in one or some libraries, order books or return them.

## Database server

To start project you should run command for a database server:

`npm run start`

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to manage JSON Server which is used as Database in the project.

Database now is holding two arrays of objects: the first for the users who log in to the library,

the second to hold information about the books.

1) Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/books` to watch list of books.

2) Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/users` to watch list of users.
